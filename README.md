# Introduction 
This repository is a guide to understand git and use it as much as possible. I just talk about commands here but there are many **GUI** to do the same thing, it also works fine, but in somes points is not that great. 

# Git commands
## Init 
The `init` command is used to set git in a folder so that we can start partitionning the project, Just type .
~~~sh
git init
~~~
## Log 
The `log` command is really usefull, it will show you every commit you have done in the past. Just type.
~~~sh
git log
~~~
